MetaBax
=======

**MetaBax** is an analog video signal emulator, which can be integrated with an existing application to recreate the retro feel of analog video broadcasting. Also included is **MetaBaxTV**, an application comparable to Trevor Blackwell's XAnalogTV screensaver for Linux, which can be used to generate "presets" for the MetaBax library.

Note that the techniques used in this application do not follow any particular analog television broadcast specification, but *have* been heavily influenced by the very common NTSC/PAL formats (with some tasteful modifications along the way :)!
